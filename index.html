<p>Old Mother Goose, when<br>
She wanted to wander,<br>
Would ride through the air<br>
On a very fine gander.<br>
<br>
Mother Goose had a house,<br>
'Twas built in a wood,<br>
Where an owl at the door<br>
For sentinel stood.<br>
<br>
This is her son Jack,<br>
A plain-looking lad,<br>
He is not very good,<br>
Nor yet very bad.<br>
<br>
She sent him to market,<br>
A live goose he bought,<br>
"Here, mother," says he,<br>
"It will not go for nought."<br>
<br>
Jack's goose and her gander<br>
Grew very fond,<br>
They'd both eat together,<br>
Or swim in one pond.</p>
